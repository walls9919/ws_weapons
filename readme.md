Hello, Walls here!

I've created a all-in one weapon damage & recoil standalone resource.

You are allowed to change the code and implement however you want to.

You can change the screenshake to whichever one suits you best. This can be done through client.lua line 44.
All the weapons have damage modifiers already set that I personally use, feel free to change it to something that you like!
There is also an option to disable headshot 1 shots if you wish.
